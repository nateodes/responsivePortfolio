	<h2> About me </h2>
		<section id= "bio">
		<p> I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, love my sports teams from there and all the great variaties of food!  Especially the pizza!  I went and graduated from Southern Illinois University of Carbondale with a degree in Psychology.  After graduating, I moved to Denver (the real sunshine state) and after some success in sales early on I decided it was time to pursue a career in programming.  I bring all the lessons I've learned from various jobs, companies and backgrounds into programming and hope to push myself to keep learning and writing functioning code. </p>
